# Face-eye-detection-using-Haar-Cascade-classifier

Here i have done face and eye detection. In order to do detection with cascade files,we first need cascade files or we can also create our own cascading files or You can use Google to find various Haar Cascades of things you may want to detect

For doing face & eye detection we use Python libraries:
1)	OpenCV                                  
3)	Numpy
